**How to execute**

1.- Checkout the repository into your machine ('git clone https://github.com/Kyronte/tiendanubeharness.git').

2.- Navigate to the folder project.

3.- Run 'gradle cleanTest test'.

**NOTE:**

Some products have been left created on purpose on the account.

This is to demonstrate that the test only creates and deletes the test product, leaving the original products untouched.
